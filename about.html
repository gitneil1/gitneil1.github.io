		  The author of this site is Neil. Well he is a nerd about comic book superheroes that's why he started this site. He is also motivated to work out because he wants to lift really heavy stuff off the ground. Gym rats, expect some work out motivations here when you're feeling lazy!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The author's favorite comic book superhero is Batman.<br>Batman is just a man but he is the most strong-willed of all superheroes. The author also wants to be strong-willed like Batman, someone who just never gives up.

		  <blockquote>
		    It's not that I am always prepared because I'm not. It's not that I have the most advanced technology because I don't. And it's sure as hell not <q>Because I'm Batman</q>.<br>
			What I am is an symbol... An idea that anyone can be a hero. I don't give up. When I'm beaten, I regroup and find a way. I am only human, but don't let that fool you either. Prep time is nothing without proper execution. Acts of heroism mean nothing if the motives aren't pure. I don't always win but I don't quit.

		  This site is intended for people who needed or needs to be someone better than they want to be. One can find many motivational quotes so they can feel empowered and do what they gotta do.
